# The Foraging Link

## Project Description

The Foraging Link is the front-end React-based user interface that interacts with the
[ForagingLink-API](https://github.com/CheyenneMDavid/ForagingLink-API). The front-end allows user
interaction with features such as browsing monthly blog posts, commenting on the posts and one
another's comments, managing user profiles, and registering for courses.

## Features

### Pages

- **`HomePage.js`** (in `pages/`): Serves as the main landing page, displaying:

  - `PostsList`
  - `HeroBanner`
  - `Sidebar` with upcoming course dates

  Its purpose is to provide an entry point for users with key content and clear navigation options.

- **`PostPage.js`** (in `pages/`): Provides the detailed view of a single post.

---

### Components

#### Global Components

- **`NavBar`**: Shows navigation options based on the user's status (signed in or signed out).
- **`Avatar`**: Displays the userâ€™s profile picture.
- **`Footer`**: Contains social media links at the bottom of the screen.

#### Post Components

- **`PostsList`**: Displays a list of all blog posts for users to browse.
  
- **`Post`**: Displays a single post with details such as title, image, content, author, and
  published date.

- **`PostPage`**: Fetches and displays the full details of a specific post, including its comments.

#### Comments Section Components

- **`CommentsSection`**: The main container for all comments related to a specific post. It uses the
  `Comment` component to show:

  - First-level comments on a post.
  - Second-level nested replies to other comments.

#### Course and Course Registration Components

- **`Sidebar`**: Displays the first three/closest dates for upcoming foraging courses.

### Post Management Features

#### Current Features

- While complete post management is handled by admins in the backend, the front end provides basic
  editing and deleting features for admins, limited to posts they authored. This allows for quick
  edits without needing to access the backend for minor tasks.

#### Future Planned Features

- Introduce a **moderator** tier of users with permissions greater than regular authenticated users.
  Moderators will be able to:
  - Create, read, update, and delete their own posts.
  - Manage posts without requiring full access to the admin panel.

### Wireframes

All desktop wireframes are based on a screen size of 1920 x 1080, with the main view limited to
1200px wide. All mobile wireframes are based on the Samsung Galaxy S20 screen size of 360 x 800.

The colors used in the wwireframes are not representational of the sites colors. They are simply
alternating colors to show division.

**Homepage Wireframe - Desktop view** (also serves as the homepage/landing page)

#### Component Planning

The component planning aims to break down the application into manageable parts, focusing on reusable components to maintain consistency and modularity.

##### Comments Section

The comments section is by far the most complex part of the application, due to the number of functionalities and conditional displays involved. To simplify and manage this complexity, I decided to break the functionality into individual reusable components which can then also be used by Posts.

## Design Choices

### Colors

The colors selected for "The Foraging Link" were chosen to align with colors found in nature, gentle
on the eye, but also a rewarding depth

- Navigation icon/links

  - Default color: #532402 (brown)
  - Color on hover: #619158 (green)
  - Current page: #619158 (green)

- Buttons

  - Default color #532402 (brown)
  - Color on hover #619158 (green)
  - Opacity on hover: 0.8

- Lines and Borders

  - #532402 (brown)

- Site Background
  - Background color: #f8f8f8 (a light, but gentle on the eyes)

### Components and Functionality

**NavBar**. Conditional display of navigation elements based on whether a user was signed in or
signed out. Intention is to engage with potentiial users, ecouraging them to join. So, the site
content is open to the public, but the ability to engage with the site content is restrictesd to
users.

- **Signed out**, displays `Home`, `Courses`, `Sign in`, `Sign up`

- **Signed in**, displays `Home`, `Courses`, `Profile` and `Sign out`
  
- **Post Listings Display**  
  The posts in the listings are presented in a condensed format to provide a quick overview. The images are styled to take up 100% of the width but only 30% of the viewport height `30vh`, ensuring consistent and proportional scaling, accompanied with a short text excerpt taken from the "Culinary Uses" field, to give users a glimpse of the content without overwhelming the interface.

  Although each post displays a heart icon and a speech bubble with their corresponding counts (if available), the icons are not interactive in the post listings. Unlike in the detail pages, where clicking these icons updates the counts, the icons in the listings are purely decorative. This design choice was made because the hover effect on the icons suggested interactivity, which could mislead users. A color change on hover without any resulting action would have conveyed a sense of incompleteness, so this behavior was removed for the post listings and saved for the detail page for a post which the entire post in the listed content is a link for.

### Form Validation and Defensive Design

Whilst the Sign-up and Sign-in forms were parallel to Code Institute's `Moments` walkthrough
project, the expected behaviour of a returned message informing the user that the field couldn't be
left empty didn't happen.

The first solution considered was to set an error state with conditional logic to display specific
messages when fields were left empty. This approach proved needlessly complex. The second solution
was to use React Hook Form, but for the simplicity needed in this form, it felt like overkill.
Instead, adding a simple `required` attribute did the job effectively, keeping the solution
browser-friendly. This approach uses the browserâ€™s own validation, so users get instant feedback
without extra code, making it simple and efficient.

## Development Challenges & Solutions

### Issue Resolution

When first creating the `PostPage`, I had difficulty fetching data, unable to get it to display the
returned JSON data in the devtools console. The issue was tracked to a mismatch in naming between
the frontend and backend.

This was resolved by:

1. Correcting the URL paths in the backend application's `urls.py` files.
2. Aligning the Axios request in the frontend to match the corrected backend paths.

Fixing **Like and Unlike** Logic
Initially following the logic for liking and unliking posts was modeled after the walkthrough project. But when liking and unliking it, instead of displaying a number or a zero, or have an absence of a number due to being zero, NaN would be displayed. Upon refreshing the page, it would return to it's expected behaviour.
The likes_count value wasn't being initialized properly when it was undefined or null.

To resolve this, the logic to handle edge cases:

- For liking a post, likes_count is initialized to 0 if
  it'sundefined, ensuring it increments correctly.

- For unliking a post, likes_count defaults to a 1 before
  decrementing, ensuring it never becomes NaN. Also, by setting it to 1 before decrementing, it doesn't run the risk of becomeing a negative number.
